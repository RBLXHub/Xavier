# Virus
is this a virüs?, 
its not virüs you şit!!, 
because the clients are in it is not signed and not tested by windows, 
thats why your windows tells it might be a malicious program or get smartscreen protected your system message, 
BUT, dont complain on this yet but, 
unlike Roblox Filtering Disabled, when i tried uploading the zip to google drive, 
it got flagged as malicious and blocked sharing the zip file to others, 
it did not happen when i tried to upload RBLXHub (RoHub) to drive 

## Hosting Your Own Game

To allow other users to connect to your webserver and join your game, you have two options

### Option 1: playit.gg (Recommended)

1.  Create a new account by clicking [this link](https://playit.gg/setup) and follow the official tutorial
2.  If you successfully setup the agent
    1.  Go to your agent
    2.  Click Add Tunnel
    3.  In "Tunnel Type" select **Something Random**
    4.  Click "Yes, i will not host malware"
    5.  Select **TCP+UDP (protocol)** in tunnel type
    6.  Set **Local Port** to `53640` and click Add tunnel
3.  **Important:** Make sure your playit.gg Application is RUNNING on your pc, otherwise it will not work
4.  Click The Address in "Public Address" (as shown below) and click copy

### Verification
You might want to test if the hosting application actually works. If it works, congratulations! Now you can share the address or ip you copied to the **#hosting-channel** so we can join your game. Make sure you specify what client you are hosting on

## How to Join

To join someone else's host, go to the **#hosting-channel** and look for the connection details

1.  **Identify the details:**
    * **ip:** IPv4 on your launcher
    * **port:** Port, yeah
    * **client:** The version required (Refer to this [Client List](https://file.garden/aNTqSg4ZkRNIiewL/görsel_2025-10-17_175627540.png))
2.  **Configure the Launcher:**
    * Copy the ip and port into the "Join" Page of the launcher
    * Select the client (like 2019M) on the list
3.  **Connect:** Click the join button

## ⚠️ Important Installation Steps

**Before downloading, you must set up an exclusion**

1. Create a new folder on your computer
2. Open your antivirus software and go to **Exclusions**
3. Add the folder you just created
4. Apply the changes
*(Search "how to add exclusions in [your antivirus name]" if you need help)*

**Why is this required?**
The download contains files that trigger false positives:
* **Unsigned Clients** (patched by local_rcc for semi-modern clients)
* **AutoIt Launcher** (compiled by me)

If you do not add the exclusion, your antivirus will likely flag these programs

**Transparency:**
If you are concerned about the launcher, I have provided the source code so you can verify it yourself
