# Virus
is this a virüs?, 
its not virüs you şit!!, 
because the clients are in it is not signed and not tested by windows, 
thats why your windows tells it might be a malicious program or get smartscreen protected your system message, 
BUT, dont complain on this yet but, 
unlike Roblox Filtering Disabled, when i tried uploading the zip to google drive, 
it got flagged as malicious and blocked sharing the zip file to others, 
it did not happen when i tried to upload RBLXHub (RoHub) to drive
