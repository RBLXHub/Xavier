# Virus
is this a virüs?, 
its not virüs you şit!!, 
because the clients are in it is not signed and not tested by windows, 
thats why your windows tells it might be a malicious program or get smartscreen protected your system message, 
BUT, dont complain on this yet but, 
unlike Roblox Filtering Disabled, when i tried uploading the zip to google drive, 
it got flagged as malicious and blocked sharing the zip file to others, 
it did not happen when i tried to upload RBLXHub (RoHub) to drive 

## Hosting Your Own Game

To allow other users to connect to your webserver and join your game, you have two options.

### Option 1: playit.gg (Recommended)

1.  Create a new account by clicking [this link](https://playit.gg/setup) and follow the official tutorial.
2.  Once you have successfully set up the agent:
    1.  Go to your agent dashboard.
    2.  Click **Add Tunnel**.
    3.  In "Tunnel Type" select **Something Random**.
    4.  Click "Yes, I will not host malware".
    5.  Select **TCP+UDP (protocol)**.
    6.  Set **Local Port** to `53640` and click **Add tunnel**.
3.  **Important:** Ensure your playit.gg application is **RUNNING** on your PC, otherwise it will not work.

### Option 2: Radmin VPN (Experimental/Known Issues)

*Note: This method is currently marked as unreliable.*

1.  Download [Radmin VPN](https://download.radmin-vpn.com/download/files/Radmin_VPN_2.0.4899.9.exe).
2.  Complete the setup.
3.  Click on **Create Network**.
4.  Set the network name and set the password to `Radmin0`.
    * *If you want a different password, please specify it in the hosting channel, otherwise others cannot join.*
5.  Click Create.
6.  Copy the IP where the [yellow highlight](https://file.garden/aNTqSg4ZkRNIiewL/görsel_2025-10-17_174717169.png) is pointing.
7.  You must specify port `53640` when sharing, because the IP redirects to localhost (127.0.0.1).

### Verification
You might want to test if the hosting application actually works. If it works, congratulations! Now you can share the address or IP you copied to the **#hosting-channel** so others can join your game. Make sure you specify what client you are hosting on.
